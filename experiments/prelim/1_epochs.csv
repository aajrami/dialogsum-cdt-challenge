#Person1#: Hmm, I have an idea that you'll like. This week, you can do a special project for class.
#Person2#: Oh, what's that?
#Person1#: I want you to watch some YouTube videos of people speaking in different English accents. I'll send you the links for the ones you should watch, they're very funny. One person does about 30 different accents in 10 minutes.
#Person2#: Wow, that's great, but, won't it be harder for me to learn English if I'm listening to so many different ways of speaking the language?
#Person1#: It shouldn't, this is just a fun project to help you get more interested in the lessons. There is a more serious side to it, though. I want you to write a one page essay about the videos and tell the class about your project on Friday. You can show some of the videos during your presentation too if you like. I think the whole class will benefit from this.
#Person2#: I can't wait to get started. Thank you, Miss Winters.",Hong thinks learning English is boring and wants something more exciting.

#Person2#: I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.
#Person1#: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
#Person2#: Sure. But, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
#Person1#: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.
#Person2#: Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.

#Person1#: Yes. It's a traditional dish.
#Person2#: And it must be very particular in cooking.
#Person1#: You are right, sir. To prepare it, a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown, and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts. That's why the dish has a bright colour.
